WORK IN PROGRESS - Sample Demo
Tested via PowerShell ISE code execution

PoSh-PortMonitor is a simple GUI thrown together to monitor endpoint ports/services.
It is done this by making connection attempts to IPs/Ports listed in HostAndPortInfo.csv 
This does not validate if a service necessarily up, but is useful to monitor if a port
is open/listening/responding, to which one can assume the a correlating serivce is up.
